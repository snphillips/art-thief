_"Good artists copy; great artists steal."_ 

I don't know about that, but I do know a good way to remove a creative block is to inspired by the work of great artists, designers and creators that have come before us. 

_Art Thief_ allows users to view random images from the Cooper Hewitt Museum's collection, based on selected keywords such as angular, art deco, modernism etc. 

_Art Thief_ is a project to experiment with the Cooper Hewitt Museum's wonderful API.
